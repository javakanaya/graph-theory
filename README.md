# Graph Theory Practicum
This collection of Python code addresses graph theory problems encountered during our practicum. Within this repository, we present our solutions to two classic graph theory problems: the Largest Monotonically Increasing Subsequence (LMIS) problem and the Knight's Tour problem.

## LMIS Problem
The LMIS problem requires finding the largest monotonically increasing subsequence in a given sequence. You can find the implementation for this problem in the [LMIS folder](LMIS/). 

## Knight's Tour Problem
The Knight's Tour problem is a classic chess problem that requires finding a sequence of moves for a knight on a chessboard such that it visits every square exactly once. The solution code for this problem is available in the [Knight's Tour folder](KnightsTour/).
